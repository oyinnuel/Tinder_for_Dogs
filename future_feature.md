	What I intend to add to the Tinder for dogs app

	• Change the profile, chat and message app to another color on over
	• Create a real form for users to fill when the profile is clicked 
	• Style the end page to be more meaningful and beautiful giving bigger font sizes to the fonts and 
	• Add a back button for users to be able to go back on what they have swiped 
	• Connect to an API to get a better experience. 
	• Make it a react app
